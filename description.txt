Cherry's Various Tiles is a pretty cool mod, it adds lots of new tiles into your game! From many many various new decoration tiles to some quality of life things, this mod is a content mod consisting of entirely new tiles as the focus. While there is a vast selection of interesting new decoration, the functional tiles are sure to make gameplay more interesting even for those who are more on the box-house side of building. New pylons are planned as well, so keep an eye out for those!

One mod is fun and all, but theses are some reccomendations to elevate the experience while playing this mod!
-The Spirit Mod, a big content mod that also adds new cool decoration.
-Chad's Furniture, a mod similiar to this but with the focus of only new decoration.
